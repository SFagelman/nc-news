## Project Summary

The purpose of this project was to consolidate my understanding of making a C.R.U.D application from a front end perspective.

Northcoders News is a news article and discussion website.

Users can:

- View and vote on articles.
- Refine articles by topic, sort by a desired key, order by ascending/descending, access different pages and limit results shown per page.
- View comments for a specific article.
- Add comments to existing articles.
- COMING SOON: Users will also be able to delete their own articles or comments, as well as vote on comments that are not their own.
